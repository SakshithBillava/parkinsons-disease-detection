# **Parkinson's Disease Detection**  
A machine learning project to detect Parkinson's disease using voice data and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

---

## 📝 **Overview**  
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect Parkinson's disease based on vocal features. It uses the `parkinsons.csv` dataset containing various parameters extracted from voice recordings.

## 🚀 **Features**  
✅ Data preprocessing and scaling using `StandardScaler`  
✅ Training using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier  
✅ Evaluation of model performance using accuracy score

## 📊 **Dataset Information**  
- The dataset contains 24 columns representing vocal features.  
- `status` column indicates the health status:  
  - `0` = Healthy  
  - `1` = Parkinson's disease
